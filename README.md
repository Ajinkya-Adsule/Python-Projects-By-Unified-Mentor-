HI Guys ,

I have completed my Python-Projects  which were assigned to put my knowledge and new skills to put the test and submit an project solution for problem statements which were   provided by Unified Mentor during the Business Analyst Internship .

1. First Projecct I was assigned was Telecommunication Industry Project in which I used  Jupyter notebook as part of my learning experience in the study of applied statistics.
 I learned various new tools .

Observations:

There are 50 phones in the data set.

There are 17 features in the data set including the "PID" feature which is used as the row index labels.

There are no missing values in the data set.

Observations:

The features "Px_h" and "Px_w" are respectively the number of pixels in the phone screen in the vertical and horizontal axes.

We created a new feature called "Px" which is the product of the features "Px_h" and "Px_w".

The median has been selected as a threshold in this case.

In case it is too strict, we can choose the mean as a threshold.

Observations:

The features "Scr_h" and "Scr_w" are respectively the height and the width of the phone screen.

We created a new feature called "Scr_d" which is essentially the length of the screen diagonal.

The upper quartile has been selected as a threshold in this case as the children were very particular on this point.

In case it is too strict, we can choose the mean or the median as a threshold.

Observations:

The features "PC" and "FC" are respectively the resolutions of the primary camera and the front camera.

The respective means have been selected as thresholds in this case.

In case it is too strict, we can choose the respective medians as thresholds.

Observations

The features "Int_Mem", "Bty_Pwr" and "RAM" are respectively the internal memory, battery power and RAM of the phones.

The respective means have been selected as thresholds in this case.

.In case it is too strict, we can choose the respective medians as thresholds

Observations:

The features "Depth" and "Weight" are respectively the depth of the phone and the weight of the phone.

The respective medians have been selected as thresholds in this case.

In case it is too strict, we can choose the respective means as thresholds.

Observations:

Based on all the logical conditions obtained through analysis of the features, we are left with three phones.

The most expensive of these phones is the "TYS938L" model and the least expensive is the "TVF078Y" model.

We could let the children choose from these three phones as per their preferences.

Observations:
The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of a feature normalizes its scale, allowing for meaningful comparison across different units and magnitudes.

This enables us to assess which features are relatively more or less variable.

The most variable feature in the original data set is Int_Mem.

The least variable feature in the original data set is Px_w.

The ratio of standard deviation to mean for the Price feature is 0.74, indicating that phone prices are indeed quite variable.

This variability in price, despite lower variability in most other features, suggests that other unmeasured or compounded factors may be influencing pricing.

# Conclusion
1. We have used concepts of descriptive statistics to study and work with a data set that contains mobile phone specifications.

2. We were able to recommend three phone models to the client which she can then propose to her children.

3. We have used concepts from descriptive statistics to analyze a dataset containing mobile phone specifications.

Through logical filtering based on feature-specific conditions (like screen quality, performance, and build), we were able to narrow down the options to three phone models.

These models meet the specified criteria and can now be confidently recommended to the client for her children to choose from based on their personal preferences.



   1.1 Statistical Techniques Used:
      Regression analysis (linear, logistic, etc.)
       Clustering (k-means, hierarchical)
         Time series analysis (ARIMA, SARIMA)
              Hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA)
               Statistical modeling e.g., generalized linear models, decision trees



    2.1. Python Libraries and Tools:
         Pandas: For data wrangling and manipulation.
           NumPy: For numerical computing.
               Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
                "used Jupyter Notebooks for development and analysis , Used visual studio code to identify errors.




   3.1   Quantifiable Achievements and Insights:
              Developed a new approach to data cleaning that significantly reduced errors
