HI Guys ,

I have completed my Python-Projects  which were assigned to put my knowledge and new skills to put the test and submit an project solution for problem statements which were   provided by Unified Mentor during the Business Analyst Internship .


1. First Projecct I was assigned was Telecommunication Industry Project in which I used  Jupyter notebook as part of my learning experience in the study of applied statistics.
 I learned various new tools and leaned


   1.1 Statistical Techniques Used:
      Regression analysis (linear, logistic, etc.)
       Clustering (k-means, hierarchical)
         Time series analysis (ARIMA, SARIMA)
              Hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA)
               Statistical modeling e.g., generalized linear models, decision trees



    2.1. Python Libraries and Tools:
         Pandas: For data wrangling and manipulation.
           NumPy: For numerical computing.
               Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
                "used Jupyter Notebooks for development and analysis , Used visual studio code to identify errors.




   3.1   Quantifiable Achievements and Insights:
              Developed a new approach to data cleaning that significantly reduced errors
   Completed the Hypothesis Testing and Null & Alternate Hypothesis in my python project .



   Please find my project files below , you may visual studio code  (recommended) or any other apllication of your choice to view my project . please check the files under this folder attached.:
